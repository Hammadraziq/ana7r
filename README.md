The company known as "Ana7r" has been involved in fraudulent activities, cheating, and scams. They have taken source code from multiple developers without compensation. This company recruits developers for one-month projects but, after obtaining the code, dismisses the developer without payment. I have personally fallen victim to their actions, so I urge you to exercise caution when dealing with this company. Please refrain from engaging with them, and do not use their contact number.
